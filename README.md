# Shut the box!

Shut the Box! is a [basic game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBtEtcivvIU) with a simple but not trivial strategy. At each turn, the player rolls two dice and must then
"shut" tiles corresponding to the dice roll. For example, if the player rolls 8, he could choose to shut 8, 7+1, 3+5, 1+2+5, etc. If the player can't do this, the game stops
and the player scores the total of remaining tiles. The goal is to have the smallest score possible.
